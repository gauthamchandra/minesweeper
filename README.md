### Minesweeper

The game rules can be found [here](http://www.freeminesweeper.org/help/minehelpinstructions.html) or if you just want to [watch a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93oSIfWN0HU)

This app uses the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to setup babel, webpack and react and the server to serve and watch the files. This was done as a very easy starting point.

### Starting the game

**NOTE**: Ensure Node is installed first.

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
2. Run `npm start` to start the server and launch the game in the browser
3. Profit?

### Development Notes

1. For static type checking, [Flow](https://flow.org/en/) was used.
2. The entrypoint to the game is in `index.js`.
